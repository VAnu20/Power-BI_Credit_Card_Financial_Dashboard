🎯 Project Objective

As part of this task, you are required to build two interactive Power BI dashboards from the provided datasets.

🗣️--> Expectations:
Visualizations should be clean, easy to interpret, and well-organized. Use appropriate chart types for the data and KPIs. Dashboards should be interactive and allow users to filter by gender, age group, and income group. Ensure that all metrics are clearly labeled and the report is visually appealing.
